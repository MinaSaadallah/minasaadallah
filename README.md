# Hey, I'm Minita

I build things on the web and automate the boring stuff.  
Mostly they work. Sometimes they don't. That's coding for you.

---

I'm all about making life easier with automation and scripts.  
If there's a repetitive task, I'll probably write a script for it.  
It's not magic, just a lot of trial and error.

---

## What I'm into

- Building websites and web apps
- Writing automation scripts (because who has time for repetitive tasks?)
- Breaking things and figuring out how to fix them
- Learning new tools and technologies

---

## The cycle

1. Write code
2. Break code
3. Fix code (or at least try)
4. Automate it
5. Repeat

---

Currently vibing with automation tools and whatever else catches my eye.

Fueled by good music and the satisfaction of watching scripts do their thing.  
Thanks for stopping by ✨
