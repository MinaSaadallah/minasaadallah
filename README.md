# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mina Saad

Just a guy from Egypt who loves making websites look good and actually work
I turn coffee into clean code and bugs into... slightly smaller bugs

---

## 🛠️ What I do
- Build stuff for the web
- Make buttons do things
- Fix things I probably broke
- Pretend to be a designer sometimes 

---

Always building, always learning.  
Thanks for checking out my profile! 🚀
