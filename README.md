# Hi, I'm Mina

I make websites.  
Sometimes they even work.

---

```javascript
const developer = {
  code: "constantly",
  debug: "relentlessly",
  deploy: "hopefully",
  coffee: "excessively",
};
```

---

## What I do

- Write code
- Break code
- Try to fix it

---

Fueled by coffee and vibes.  
Thanks for stopping by.
